# RemindMe
RemindMe is a Windows application to remind of the islamic prayer times, made with WinForms and C#.

This app was made for personal use in the first place, so it may be a bit messy and some features are uncompleted or need polishing.
I decided to open source it so might some people find it useful or interisting.

To clarify things, I won't be maintaining it actively, but contributions are welcome, I will leave a TODO list with things that need some work, also add to the list if you have leftovers from your work.
If you are interisted in fixing, polishing or adding features feel free to open a PR.

## Features
See [TODO List](#TODO) to know if the feature is ready or has problems.
